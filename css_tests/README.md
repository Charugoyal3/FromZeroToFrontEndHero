# css_tests
This directory contains some simple examples of the basic CSS properties like font, color and position, for instance.

The examples are mostly from [MDN's "Getting started with CSS"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started) and they are in sub-folders when appropriate.

You can use and copy anything from here, if you want. Feel free.
