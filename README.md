# FromZeroToFrontEndHero
Repository to store my tests and experiments for the FreeCodeCamp guide

This repository is created just to store the tests, examples and experiments proposed in the FreeCodeCamp's guide "From Zero to Front End Hero" that you can read [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/from-zero-to-front-end-hero-part-1-7d4f7f0bff02#.2obhd5uwd).

Repository for didactic purposes, it does not contains any production or usable code.

You can use and copy anything from here, if you want. Feel free.
